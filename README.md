Finastra - Mortgage Loan Origination System Analytics
=====================================================

Who is Finastra?
----------------

-   3rd largest Fintech globally with over 9000 customers including 90 of top
    100 banks globally

-   Top 100 Azure consumer with monthly consumption of over \$1.8 million.

What was the Finastra & Microsoft Opportunity?
----------------------------------------------

MortgageBot is Finastra’s loan originating system used by over 1800 credit
unions and small banks across the US. Although Finastra does collect and store
its customers (banks and CUs) data through MortgageBot application, its
customers only receive a static monthly report about with few data points like
total applications submitted and processed.

The Microsoft team collaborating closely with the Innovation team at Finastra in
90 days sprint to identify and prove out the value of Microsoft advanced
analytics, AI and Machine Learning infused into the existing Finastra
MortgageBot solution. This infusion resulted in empowering Finastra’s customers.
What did the resulting Innovation look like? 
---------------------------------------------

With MortgageBot being the central service, we were able to calculate KPIs like
number of applications submitted vs processed, time to process application and
the average credit score for approved application all benchmarked against the
similar banks in the same region. This allows banks to see how is their risk
appetite compared to other banks in the same region. On the ML front, automated
data driven customer segmentation using clustering helped banks understand the
nature of their customers, for example, 27% of the customer base is male, 25 to
40 years with average annual income of \$65K and credit score averaging 580. ML
also helps banks with forecasting of number of applications in the next 3 days
and to benchmark against similar banks. **See sample outputs below:**
